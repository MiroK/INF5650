=================================================================================================================================================
Notes and __scripts__ for group exercises in **INF5650**, *Numerical methods for
partial differential equations 2*, that I lead in spring semester of 2014. The
scripts cover exercises from the lecture notes, but there are also many that
show features that I consider interesting/amusing. These are as optional as one
can get, however they might give a deeper insight into the covered topics.
Structure of the repository follows roughly the chapters from lecture notes.

* Lecture-1,2 :  *A short look at functional analysis and Sobolev space*,
                *Crash course in Sobolev spaces*

* Lecture-3,7 :  *The finite element method*,
                *Finite element error estimate*

* Lecture-5   :  *Discretization of a convection-diffusion problem* 

* Lecture-6   :  *Stokes problem*

* Lecture-8   :  *Iterative methods*

* Lecture-11  :  *The incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations*

More information about the course can be found at UiO website

__Scripts__: All the scripts were written for FEniCS 1.3.0 and without minor
tweaks might not work with prior or later releases. Typically dx --> dx(mesh)
is required.
